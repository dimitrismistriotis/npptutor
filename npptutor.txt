	This tutorial is an attempt to port "vimtutor" in the windows environment, more specially 
notepad++. The idea originates from the Pragmatic programmer's dogma that each developer in 
order to increase his productivity should learn one text editor inside out. With vim there is 
vimtutor, This .txt file aims to do the same with notepadd++.

0. Learn how to "touch" type
----------------------------

	This is not a strict notepad++ feature, but is the first thing to consider in increasing 
productivity. This can be achieved by a "blank" keyboard like this: 
http://www.daskeyboard.com/#slide2
	A cheaper option is playing some typing games, such as Z-Type:

1. Line Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1 Ups and Downs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can move a line up and down by holding Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down Arrow.

-------------- Exercise Area -------------------


Move this line just before the dashes("-") above and then land it on the bottom ones.


-------------- Exercise Area -------------------

In order to exercise, use the appropriate line operators to fix the text below. 
Remember hands away from mouse and copy/paste.

This should be the fifth  line (5)
This should be the fourth line (4)
This should be the second line (2)
This should be the third line  (3)
This should be the first line  (1)

1.2 The case
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets introduce upper and lower case-ing. Remember not to use the mouse!

SeLeCt THiS tExT aNd MaKe It LoWeRcAsE, wItH tHe HeLp Of CtRl + U. tHeN fIx It By 
SeLeCtInG sPeCiFiC lEtTeRs AnD cTrL + sHiFt + U.

1.3 Line joining and spliting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are still tapping the surface, but even with those small tricks, my productivity has 
gained a bonus already. An action that happens a lot while coding/working is the need 
to split a big line into more smaller ones, or the other way round (like when we have 
comments in different lines, which we want to tide up)

Splitting:
This is a lont line whose size makes it really unreadable. Wow I can bubble so much. If you want to break it down into multiple lines, use Ctrl + I. See the line numbers changing on the left. More placeholder text here.

Joining:

/* It's lame 
to waste 5 lines 
for something 
so small, 
select text, 
then use Ctrl + J */

1.4 More edit short-cuts

Line Duplication (duplicate me twice): Ctrl + D.

    Select and indent these lines further (Tab :-)),
	then unindent them (Shift + Tab). Then join them.

2. TextFX
~~~~~~~~~

	The purpose of this set of exersises is to familiarize with the options available 
in TextFX. Some of them are very useful and were found while writing this text :-) 
Unfortunately most of them are not accompanied by keyboard shortcuts.
 	Feel free to skip sections not related to youu interests (example (X + 1).2 if your 
day to day tasks do not involve binary arithmetic)
 
2.1 General text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the anser and put it after the colon.

Word count this sentence:

2.2 Binary Arithmetic

same with 48879 (BSD trick):

etc...

2.3 Text Formating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clean this line from the spaces at the end:                                                                                                                                        

Insert a ruler after this line:

Swap quotes in one shot (see "Quotation Marks" in
